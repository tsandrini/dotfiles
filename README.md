# dotfiles

## About

These are my dotfiles, which I'm using to speed up my workflow at the highest rate. I'm running __i3wm__ combined with __archlinux__. Only these suits my needs, which can be seen in my dotfiles as they are really customized in order to fullfil all of my specific tasks.
Feel free to use any of these files :)

## Configuration

My whole setup highly depends on __s-ol/themer__, which provides me such a magnificent option to generate colors based on a wallpaper for my whole setup just by one command. So all of my important configuration files can be found in __.config/themer/i3/templates__.
