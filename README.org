* About
These are my personal dotfiles. They are probably not neither up to date or
complete since I really hate this style of personal system managment and that
is the reason (one of many) why I will be probably switching to [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]. That
doesn't mean that I dislike [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch]], quite on the contrary, however, aftef all
these years I don't really enjoy literally wasting time over and over
wiring and fixing basic unix stuff which could be once for all solved in a nice
declarative way :smirk-cat:.
* Software
I use the following software
